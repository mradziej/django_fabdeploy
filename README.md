This project will eventually provide tools for systematic deployment for django projects in virtual environments.
It depends on fabric as underlying framework.

The current status is pre-alpha. It works for me, but is only rudimentarily tested and misses:

- a sample fabfile,
- documentation for the user,
- unit tests,
- can only deal with simple requirement files and cpython as target.

It works for python2.7. Python3 will eventually be supported, but is not a priority for me.

If you are interested, please contact me.
